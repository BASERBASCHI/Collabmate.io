## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and build processes
- **State Management**: React hooks with custom Firebase integration hooks
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with custom styling

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication with Google OAuth
- **Real-time Data**: Firestore for real-time messaging and user data
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini API for intelligent suggestions and chat assistance

### Data Storage Strategy
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL (configured via Drizzle) for structured data
- **Real-time Data**: Firebase Firestore for user profiles, matches, messages, and real-time features
- **File Storage**: Firebase Storage for user avatars and project assets
- **Session Management**: Connect-pg-simple for session storage

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- Firebase Authentication with email/password and Google OAuth
- Custom hooks (`useFirebaseAuth`) for authentication state management
- Modal-based login/signup with form validation
- Profile completion flow for new users

### AI-Powered Features
- **Smart Matching**: Algorithm that calculates compatibility scores based on skills, interests, and preferences
- **Project Suggestions**: Gemini AI generates personalized project ideas based on user skills
- **Chat Assistance**: Real-time conversation suggestions to facilitate collaboration
- **Ask Gemini**: Interactive AI assistant for development and collaboration questions

### Real-time Communication
- Firestore-powered real-time messaging system
- Message history with sender identification
- Chat suggestions generated by AI
- Voice/video call placeholders for future WebRTC integration

### User Management
- Comprehensive user profiles with skills, interests, and preferences
- Profile strength calculation and completion prompts
- Location-based matching with distance preferences
- Work style and personality tag matching

### Dashboard & Discovery
- Personalized dashboard with match recommendations
- Project suggestion cards with team-building capabilities
- Statistics tracking for user engagement
- Sidebar navigation with quick actions

## Data Flow

1. **User Authentication**: Firebase Auth → Custom hooks → React state
2. **Profile Data**: Firestore → Custom hooks → Component props
3. **Real-time Messaging**: Firestore listeners → Message hooks → Chat UI
4. **AI Interactions**: User input → Gemini API → Response processing → UI updates
5. **Matching Algorithm**: User preferences → Firebase queries → Compatibility scoring → Match display

## External Dependencies

### Replit Services
- **Authentication**: Secure OpenID Connect authentication system
- **Database**: PostgreSQL database with automatic provisioning
- **Environment**: Cloud development and deployment platform

### Google Gemini AI
- **Project Suggestions**: Server-side generation of personalized project ideas
- **Chat Assistance**: Server-side conversation suggestions
- **Q&A Assistant**: Server-side responses to development and collaboration questions

### UI & Styling
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Radix UI**: Headless component primitives
- **shadcn/ui**: Pre-built component library with consistent design

### Database & ORM
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary relational database (configured but not actively used in current implementation)
- **Drizzle ORM**: Type-safe database interactions
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL provider

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- Vite dev server for frontend with hot reload
- Express server with TypeScript compilation
- Environment variables for API keys and database connections
- Replit-specific configurations for cloud development

### Production Build
- Vite production build outputting to `dist/public`
- ESBuild compilation of server code
- Node.js production server serving static files and API routes

### Environment Configuration
- Database URL for PostgreSQL connection
- Firebase configuration object
- Google Gemini API key
- Session secrets for authentication

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Dual Database Strategy**: PostgreSQL for structured data with Firestore for real-time features provides flexibility and performance
2. **Component-Based UI**: Modular React components with TypeScript for maintainability and type safety
3. **Custom Hooks Pattern**: Encapsulates Firebase interactions and state management for reusability
4. **AI-First Approach**: Integrated Gemini AI throughout the user experience rather than as an afterthought
5. **Real-time Priority**: Firestore listeners enable instant updates for messaging and match notifications
6. **Mobile-Responsive Design**: Tailwind CSS ensures consistent experience across devices

The application follows modern full-stack development practices with emphasis on real-time collaboration, AI enhancement, and user experience optimization.
